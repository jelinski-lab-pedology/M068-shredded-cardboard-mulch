# Agenda Items

## Industry Panel Update

**Cherry Flowers** joins the meeting to provide insights on organic certification requirements related to cardboard mulch. Key points:

- Cardboard is generally allowed for mulch under [OMRI](omri.org) regulations as long as it's not waxed, treated with fungicides, or contains prohibited substances
- There are some limitations around glossy/colored inks 
- Recycled cardboard specifications are unclear - does this refer to cardboard that has been previously recycled or cardboard that will be recycled after use as mulch?
- Recommends checking with specific organic certifier before using as policies differ slightly  
- Shared experience using burlap coffee bags as mulch - more durable than cardboard sheets
- Shredded cardboard likely easier to apply than sheets around existing plants
