# Metadata for Deliverable 3: Connect on-farm practices to broader systems

## Approach

To understand the relationship between shredded cardboard and broader cardboard production processes, environmental justice, and climate change, we will conduct 3 tours of industrial facilities and community farms, involving 15-20 people per tour. Tours will help us build connections and establish a 2-4 industry advisory panel with representatives from cardboard production, city/county waste management, and other related sectors to provice advice on our project.

## Deliverables

We will connect shredded cardboard mulching practices to broader environmental justice and climate change adaptation efforts by establishing an industry advisory panel, conducting a literature review, and facilitating three tours per year to sites such as cardboard production, recycling, and composting facilities, garden networks, or community organizations addressing climate change.
